In this project, we see the Predictive Modeling with bioinformatic data- methylation values for an individual


Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and individual as a table (“MethylDataWithDbgapId.txt”). Each column is an individual and each row is a CpG, values in the table are methylation values.

“subjects.txt” has information on the individuals. The most important attribute here is the age. The ids (db gap ids) in this table should match the columns in the first table. There are other attributes such as sex and Race, that can also be important. 

Problem: 
What is the relationship between age and methylation?

0) Which strategies/methods can be used to test these ideas on this data set?

1) Is methylation predictive of age (previous research indicates so)?  

2) Are all CpGs associated with age? if not, which CpGs are more important for age prediction?
